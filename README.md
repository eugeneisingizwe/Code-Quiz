# Code-Quiz

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. 
- This project was built becasue at some point in my journey to become a full-stack web developer, I will likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. 
- This project helps me get prepare a typical coding assessment which includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

- In this project I learned how to traverse the DOM, set attrabutes, append elemets to the HTML body, adding event listers to the to perform a click function, and how to set and get an item from the local storage.
